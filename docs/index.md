## About

We are Ed Mancebo and Brenda Choy.  We rent properties in the city of Seattle. We're not a large company with a whole portfolio of properties, we are just renting out places that we have personally owned and lived in in the past.

Our aim is to rent at a fair price and to be attentive to maintenance needs.

## Currently available

There are no rentals currently available at this time.
